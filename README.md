Just a project to learn about boost libraries and C++.
Inspired from boost::asio tutorials from boost.org.

This project is mostly a feature creep. Got an Idea about something new then try to implement it.
Exception handling and resolving compiler warnings have less priority than any new feature.

Requirements:
1. CMake
2. Any C++ compiler (I am using g++ and clang++)
3. Boost libraries
4. SQLite3
5. Qt5

Building on linux:
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
